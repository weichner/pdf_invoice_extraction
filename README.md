**About:**

This application takes one of the invoice you choose (A, B, or C). The invoice you are uploading and add it to a SQL database and NOSQL database.
This helps the user to be able to see the invoice information in a better way and saves that information in
a database.
The application was developed with Python and FastAPI using libraries like PDFplumber, REgex.
For the SQL database I used SQLite and SQLAlchemy and for the NoSQL database I used MongoDB and MongoDB engine. 
The application consists of 9 Endpoints such as POST, GET and DELETE

**Why I created this app**

Since the first moment I decided to become a developer was because I wanted to innovate and create good things which are
going to help other developers/people/companies.
I found very interesting to create this application because is very useful to be able to detail every important point of
the invoice you are using and be able to keep that data in a database is simply wonderful.
